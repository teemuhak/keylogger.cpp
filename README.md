# simple-keylogger
Keylogger sends any logged keystrokes from the victim's machine back to the attacker.

Increase the sleep time if you are getting repeated characters, and lower it if you are missing characters.

1. Compile the code at the victim's machine.
2. Start a Netcat listener on port 5555 in the attacker machine.
3. Run the compiled code in the victim's machine.

Only use this tool for targets you are allowed to.
